# semantic_change_detection

## General

This is a repositoty for our work submitted to AAAI-25. A contexual embeddings based approach aims at detecting words with meaning or usage change in two corpora.
We will update the code and data as soon.

## Content
The 'data' file contains:
  1) data_description.pdf: the data source & description for experiment (SemEval2020 task 1) and application (USPTO granted utility patent, 1960-2022).
  2) ./data/additional data for patent prerocessing/ : the customized stopwords, greek and symbols for USPTO patent.

The 'code' file contains:
  1) code for the proposed detection process, typical instance extraction process and visualization process.
  2) code for preprocessing the patent dataset (for an example of application of the proposed method)
